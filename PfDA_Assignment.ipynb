    "For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this project you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do), but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set. \n",

    "## Initial Research\n",
    " > 02/11/2023: After group call to discuss project, I looked at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=Timeseries), [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/free-public-data-sets), [Open Data](data.gov.ie) and [Gretel AI](Gretel.ai) \n",
    " >\n",
    " > 03/11/2023: Revisited [OpenData](data.gov.ie) as it is open source Irish data from the Central Statisitcs Office webpage with a wide variety of datasets. Three tables in particular found here - \n",
    " >\n",
    " > Table 1: https://data.cso.ie/table/AKM01 - **AKM01 Intake of Cows Milk by Creameries and Pasteurisers**\n",
    " >\n",
    " > Table 2: https://data.cso.ie/table/MTM01 - **MTM01 Rainfall**\n",
    " >\n",
    " > Table 3: https://data.cso.ie/table/MTM02 - **MTM02 Temperature**\n",
    " >\n",
    " > I was intrigued to look at any correlation between milk fat content (%) or protein content (%) and Irish weather as Irish dairy is one of our major exports, with \"€6.8bn worth of Irish dairy exported worldwide in 2022\" (Freiburg, 2022). I was interested to see if the correlation is visible from historical data, could I model future fat and protein content based on climate change predictions. \n",
    " >\n",
    " > According to Linn (1988), in the American dairy sector \"seasonal variations in milk fat percentages are well recognized, with summer months averaging 0.4 percentage units less than winter months\". Aidan Brennan, in an article on The Farmer's Journal in May 2021, described torrential rain in Ireland at that time as resulting \"in a big drop in milk yield\".   \n",
    " >\n",
    " > The *Rainfall* and *Temperature* datasets start in January 1958 and runs up to December 2022 and contains three measurements - *total rainfall(mm), most rainfall in a day(mm), and raindays (0.2mm or more)* and five measurements - *average maximum temperature, average minimum temperature, highest temperature, lowest temperature and mean temperature (all in degrees celsius)*. The measurements are taken across 15 meteorological weather stations in Ireland (Belmullet, Bitt, Casement, Claremorris, Clones, Cork Airport, Dublin Airport, Galway, Kilkenny, Malin Head, Mullingar, Roches Point, Rosslare, Shannon Airport and Valentia Observatory). I intend to calculate a national monthly average from these measurements. The date format is in YYYYM01-YYYYM12. \n",
    " >\n",
    " > The *Intake of Cows Milk by Creameries and Pasteurisers* dataset starts in January 1980 (it actually starts in the file at January 1975 however there is no data values prior to the January 1980). The data runs up to September 2023. There are three measurements - *intake of cows milk by creameries and pasteurisers (millions of litres), fat content (%) and protein content (%)*. I intend to focus purely on fat content and protein content as the climate could impact both measurements and while intake could be impacted by climate, it could equally be impacted by economic factors (demand and pricing).\n",
    " >\n",
    " > The date format for *Intake of Cows Milk by Creameries and Pasteurisers* is YYYY January - YYYY December. I will have the raw files saved as *irishmilkproduction.csv* , *irishrainfall.csv* and *irishtemperature.csv* and then amend the date format of all files to MM-YYYY to use as the column to merge the files on and create one csv file to use for the Pandas DataFrame.\n",
